# Buzz Me In
Control the front gate buzzer of an old apartment building with a mobile app so you can trigger it from anywhere in the world. All you need is a free app called Blynk and a WiFi capable Arduino Board connected to a relay module.

# WHY?
If you are like me and live in an old apartment building with one of those analog push button front gate buzzer buttons...you know the ones where you can let people in your front gate by pressing a button that "buzzes" them in while you hold it down...then you've likely wished you could access it virtually through an iPhone app.

Especially on those days you forget your keys and really need to get into your building quickly, or if an important delivery arrives and you aren't home to let the delivery person in, or you just want to spend a day building something fun with Arduino.

Well now you can! Plus, if you are new to Arduino, it could be a great practical starter project to introduce you to some of the basic concepts.

# What you'll need
* An Arduino Uno with WiFi Shield or ESP32 / ESP8266 board that already has WiFi Builtin.
* A Relay Module
* The Blynk App
